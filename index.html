						**Natural Language Processing** is the challenging task of:

						*analyzing*, *understanding*, and *generating* natural languages,

						i.e. languages that are naturally spoken or written by humans.
					</script>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## Why is NLP challenging?
						(compared to programming languages)

						- text is ambiguous
						- most utterances are not instructions or facts
						- even humans are crap at NLP
						- often depends on a life-time of learned common knowledge for context
					</script>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## Examples

						- machine translators
						- sentiment analysers
						- text summarizers
						- entity extraction (names, locations, events, ...)
						- chatbots
						- image search/captioning
						- text classification (spam, fake news, pro or con)
						- speech recognition
						- search engines

						## NLP Pipeline

						1. **tokenize**: break up your text data into chunks
						2. turn text into **numerical data**
						3. condense the data so it captures **meaning**
						4. **search** for a response using the meaning
						5. use encoded response to **generate** new text

						(Not all applications implement all steps.)
					</script>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## 1. Breaking up your text

						Use: [spaCy](https://spacy.io) or [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org)
					</script>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## 1. Breaking up your text

						**corpus**: total collection of **documents** of text you use
						* e-mail collection, news articles, web pages, chat conversations
					</script>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## 1. Breaking up your text

						**segments**: cut document into meaningful units (sentences)
						* 2019 is a way to start a sentence, i.e. that stinks?!
					</script>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## 1. Breaking up your text

						* **tokens**: smallest elements you work with (usually words)
							+ `"I am red." → ["I", "am", "red"]`
							+ `"don’t" → [“do”, “n’t”] or [“don’t”] or [“do”, “not”]`
						* consider **n-grams**
							+ `["ice cream"]` (bi-gram)
							+ `["trick or treat"]` (tri-gram)
					</script>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## 1. Breaking up your text

						build a **lexicon** (your 'dictionary')
						* contains tokens + n-grams

					</script>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## 1. Breaking up your text

						additional cleaning of your lexicon:

						* **normalization**
							+ `["trump", "Trump", "TRUMP"] → "Trump"`
						* **stemming** (pre-, post-fixes)
							+ `["clothes", "cloth", "clothing"] → "cloth"`
						* **lemmatization** (combine similar meaning)
							+ `["do", "did", "done"] → ["do"]`
							+ `["lots", "plenty", "heaps", "tons", "numerous"] → ["many"]`

					</script>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## 1. Breaking up your text

						One last thing you may encounter:

						"You **(SUBJECT/PRONOUN)** eat **(VERB)** large **(OBJECT/ADJECTIVE)** apples **(OBJECT/NOUN)**."

						Part of Speech tagging, *don't try it at home*.

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## 2. Turn text into **numerical data**

						We can use statistics and basic machine learning once we turn words into numbers.

						The simplest is: **one-hot encoding**.

						* Dog → [1, 0, 0, ....., 0]
						* Cat → [0, 1, 0, ....., 0]
						* Zorblax → [0, 0, 0, ....., 1]

						**Cons:** huge (empty) matrices, contains little statistical information
					</script>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## 2. Turn text into **numerical data**

						**[Bag of Words (BOW)](https://pythonprogramminglanguage.com/bag-of-words/)**, or count dictionary

						* “A duck is a bird” → [“duck”: 1, “is”: 1, “a”: 2, “bird”: 1]

						**Pros:** summarizes an entire segment statistically, <br>classifier can be trained with a single long vector instead of sparse matrix

						**Cons:** you lose word order
					</script>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## 2. Turn text into **numerical data**

						When comparing data for comparable content, normalize on sentence length.

						* “A duck is a bird” → [“duck”: 0.2, “is”: 0.2, “a”: 0.4, “bird”: 0.2]

						Or boost unique words with a **[TF-IDF](https://nlpforhackers.io/tf-idf/) (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)** vector.

						**Pros:** summarizes an entire segment statistically compared to the rest of the corpus
					</script>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## 2. Turn text into **numerical data**

						Comparing data using distance metrics to find closest (statistical) matches:

						* **Euclidian distance** (Pythagorean distance along all dimensions)
						* **[cosine similarity](http://blog.christianperone.com/2013/09/machine-learning-cosine-similarity-for-vector-space-models-part-iii/)** angle between two vectors (aligned meaning)

						Once you master this you can create: [search engines](https://medium.com/@deangelaneves/how-to-build-a-search-engine-from-scratch-in-python-part-1-96eb240f9ecb), all kinds of classifications such as sentiment/[spam](https://narengowda.github.io/logistic-regression-sms-spam-ham-classification-using-tfidf-vectorizer/)/sarcasm, or a [Q&A chat bot](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/building-a-simple-chatbot-in-python-using-nltk-7c8c8215ac6e) [with large corpus of questions with answers](http://www.wildml.com/2016/07/deep-learning-for-chatbots-2-retrieval-based-model-tensorflow/).

						## 3. condense the data into **meaning**

						* previous methods did not capture meaning
						* worked with large vectors leading to the **curse of dimensionality**
					</script>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## 3. condense the data into **meaning**

						Reduce dimensionality or condensing meaning using **topic vectors**, we can now search using these topic vectors instead of TF-IDF. This is called **semantic search**.

						* **[Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)](http://mccormickml.com/2016/03/25/lsa-for-text-classification-tutorial/)** is equal to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) but for NLP.
							- tries to spread topics as much as possible (good for spam detection)
						* **[Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDiA)](https://towardsdatascience.com/end-to-end-topic-modeling-in-python-latent-dirichlet-allocation-lda-35ce4ed6b3e0)**
							- tries to obtain topics with strongest meaning resemblance (best for most use cases)

						The library [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) can do this for you.
					</script>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## 3. condense the data into **meaning**

						**Word vectors** or **word embedding**: In effect, a word vector determines the meaning of a word by the type of words it is seen with in proximity.

						Adding the word vectors of a sentence generates a vector that conveys the combined meaning of that sentence: math with words!

						* “king” + “woman” - "man" → “queen”
						* “Harry Potter” + “university” → “Hogwarts”

						Three popular (pre-trained) implementations are Google **[Word2Vec](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/)**, Stanford's **[GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)**, and Facebook's **[fastText](https://fasttext.cc)**.

						If you want to [train your own](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-beginners-guide-to-word-embedding-with-gensim-word2vec-model-5970fa56cc92), train a **skip-gram** or **Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)** algorithm; for documents use [Doc2vec](https://medium.com/wisio/a-gentle-introduction-to-doc2vec-db3e8c0cce5e).
					</script>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## 3. condense the data into **meaning**

						By looking at words independently we have lost information about:
						- the order of the words in a text,
						- the proximity of words within a sentence
						- the hidden layer of meaning within word combination

						Hence:
						**Deep Learning:** from meaning to contextual understanding and generation [using for instance Keras](https://nlpforhackers.io/keras-intro/)

					</script>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>

						## 3. condense the data into **meaning**

						Use **[1D Convolutional Neural Networks](https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2019/03/09/deeplearning_architectures_text_classification/)** (CNN) to crack the more difficult NLP problems:
						- input is a 2D list of word vectors (for each word in a segment) zero-padded to get a fixed size
						- convolution is only 1D, size of the filter window determines considering length of n-grams
						- all other tricks for CNNs apply (pooling, drop out, etc)

						**Cons:** you can only classify text

						## 5. **Generate** new text

						For text prediction and generation we can use a **[Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)** layer.

						With an LSTM you also capture the time dimension in the [memory cell](https://livebook.manning.com/book/natural-language-processing-in-action/chapter-9/31) of the LSTM layer: **thought vector**. We call this state the thought vector. It not only summarizes a text, it encodes the train-of-thought and context of a statement.

						Applications:
						- Produce new works of Shakespeare
						- Co-authoring books ([Ronald Giphart's _Ik, Robot_](https://www.vice.com/nl/article/bj7ve4/we-spraken-ronald-giphart-over-hoe-hij-zijn-nieuwe-werk-samen-met-ai-maakte))
						- [Reproducing Trump tweets](https://github.com/eleurent/make-lstm-great-again)

						**Cons:** good at _how_ something is said, mimicking style. You have little control on the content.
					</script>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## 5. **Generate** new text

						To really create novel text we use LSTMs in a **[Sequence-to-Sequence](https://livebook.manning.com/book/natural-language-processing-in-action/chapter-10/22)** model or **encoder-decoder architecture**.

						Pipeline:
						- First train an encoder LSTM and take out its thought vector
						- Inject the thought vector in the decoder LSTM and predict whole new output.

						Applications:
						- [machine translations](https://blog.keras.io/a-ten-minute-introduction-to-sequence-to-sequence-learning-in-keras.html)
						- chatbot conversations, Q&A bots
						- document summarization

						**Cons:** you need a huge amount of data to produce correct grammar
					</script>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## X. From text to knowledge

						**Entity** and relation extraction:
						- "Lecturers works at Fontys", "Olaf is a lecturer"
							- 'Olaf' → name person, 'Fontys' → name school, 'lecturer' → occupation
							- ['Olaf', 'is-a', 'lecturer']
							- ['lecturer', 'works-for', 'Fontys']

						The resulting **knowledge graph** can be [queried](https://quepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html):
							- "List work-for Fontys"
							- "What is Olaf?"
							- "Olaf works-for Fontys?"

						**Cons:** Knowledge graphs are slowly crawling out of a depressing winter, so examples are often stale
					</script>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## X. The holy grail of NLP

						Independent algorithms can statistically classify, summarize meaning and find content related in meaning, predict and generate new text.

						**But** while it appears to understand text, it does not understand it's own output.

						To create a high-quality NLP bot, we need to combine all of the methods above and feed the output back into the NLP algorithms, for instance:
						- spell/grammar check its own output
						- do sentiment analysis of its own output and choose a proper tone of voice
						- reject answers that are in meaning too far away from the user's input
						- ...
