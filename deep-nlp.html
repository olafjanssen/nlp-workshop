						**Natural Language Processing** is the challenging task of:

						*analyzing*, *understanding*, and *generating* natural languages,

						i.e. languages that are naturally spoken or written by humans.

						## NLP Pipeline

						1. **tokenize**: break up your text data into chunks
						2. turn text into **numerical data**
						3. condense the data so it captures **meaning**
						4. **search** for a response using the meaning
						5. use encoded response to **generate** new text

						(Not all applications implement all steps.)

						## 5. **Generate** new text

						- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) (Do not use)
						- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
						- Sequence-to-Sequence models
						- Transformers (robots in disguise)

						## 5. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

						Tries to tackle that A/CNNs expect fixed input and output length, by allowing to rembember previous results, see [explanation](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-rnns/).
						
						**Pro:** simple, understandable implementation

						**Cons:** exploding/vanishing gradients makes it impractical for larger problems

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## 5. Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

						To improve on RNNs, we can use a **[Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)** layer ([more explanation](https://medium.com/mlreview/understanding-lstm-and-its-diagrams-37e2f46f1714)), by adding more elaborate forget/memory gates.

						With an LSTM you also capture the time dimension in the [memory cell](https://livebook.manning.com/book/natural-language-processing-in-action/chapter-9/31) of the LSTM layer: **thought vector**. We call this state the thought vector. It not only summarizes a text, it encodes the train-of-thought and context of a statement.

						**Pros:** also works for other time-series type of data

						**Cons:** good at _how_ something is said, mimicking style. You have little control on the content.

						## 5. **Generate** new text with Seq2Seq

						To really create novel text we use LSTMs in a **[Sequence-to-Sequence](https://livebook.manning.com/book/natural-language-processing-in-action/chapter-10/22)** model or **encoder-decoder architecture** ([more explanation](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/intuitive-understanding-of-seq2seq-model-attention-mechanism-in-deep-learning-1c1c24aace1e)).

						Pipeline: First train an encoder LSTM and take out its thought vector. Inject the thought vector in the decoder LSTM and predict whole new output.

						Applications:
						- [machine translations](https://blog.keras.io/a-ten-minute-introduction-to-sequence-to-sequence-learning-in-keras.html)
						- Chatbot conversations, Q&A bots, Document summarization, Produce new works of Shakespeare
						- Co-authoring books ([Ronald Giphart's _Ik, Robot_](https://www.vice.com/nl/article/bj7ve4/we-spraken-ronald-giphart-over-hoe-hij-zijn-nieuwe-werk-samen-met-ai-maakte))
						- [Reproducing Trump tweets](https://github.com/eleurent/make-lstm-great-again)

						**Cons:** you need a huge amount of data to produce correct grammar, good at _how_ something is said, mimicking style. You have little control on the content.

						## 5. Transformers

						Since the introduction of the Bi-directional [Transformer architecture](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/). NLP has taken another leap. Meaning is no longer context-free as with word embeddings but completely depended on context, notable examples: BERT, GPT-2/3, XLNET, T5.
						
						Transformer based models use _self-attention_ and _positional encoding_, _segment encoding_, _multi-headed attention_... 
						
						**Pros:** allows transfer learning, limit has not been reached yet

						- [Explanation of BERT](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/09/demystifying-bert-groundbreaking-nlp-framework/)
						- [BERT Demo](http://mccormickml.com/2019/05/14/BERT-word-embeddings-tutorial/)

						## X. From text to knowledge

						**Entity** and relation extraction:
						- "Lecturers works at Fontys", "Olaf is a lecturer"
							- 'Olaf' → name person, 'Fontys' → name school, 'lecturer' → occupation
							- ['Olaf', 'is-a', 'lecturer']
							- ['lecturer', 'works-for', 'Fontys']

						The resulting **knowledge graph** can be [queried](https://quepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html):
							- "List work-for Fontys"
							- "What is Olaf?"
							- "Olaf works-for Fontys?"

						**Cons:** Knowledge graphs are slowly crawling out of a depressing winter, so examples are often stale

						## X. The holy grail of NLP

						Independent algorithms can statistically classify, summarize meaning and find content related in meaning, predict and generate new text.

						**But** while it appears to understand text, does it understand its own output? Watch an [interview with GPT-3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqbB07n_uQ4&ab_channel=EricElliott).

						To create a high-quality NLP bot, we need to combine all of the methods above and feed the output back into the NLP algorithms, for instance:
						- spell/grammar check its own output
						- do sentiment analysis of its own output and choose a proper tone of voice
						- reject answers that are in meaning too far away from the user's input
						- fact checking, world building
						- ...
